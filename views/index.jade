    #about
      .wrap
        p WP Sync DB eliminates the manual work of migrating a WP database. Copy your db from one WP install to another with a single-click in your dashboard. Especially handy for syncing a local development database with a live site.

            p Huge database? No prob. WP Sync DB has been tested with tables several GBs in size.

          li
            h3 Detect Limitations Automatically
            p WP Sync DB checks both the remote and local servers to determine limitations and optimize for performance. For example, we detect the MySQL max_allowed_packet_size and adjust how much SQL we execute at a time.

          li
            h3 Sync Media Libraries Between Installations
            :markdown
              Using the optional [WP Sync DB Media Files](http://github.com/wp-sync-db/wp-sync-db-media-files) addon, you can have media files synced between installs too.

          li
            h3 Selective Sync
            p WP Sync DB lets you choose which DB tables are migrated. Have a huge analytics table you'd rather not send? Simply deselect it and it won't be synced.

                h4 Pull: Replace a Local DB with a Remote DB
                p If you have a test site setup locally but you need the latest data from the production server, just install WP Sync DB on both sites and you can pull the live database down, replacing your local database in just a few clicks.
              li
                h4 Push: Replace a Remote DB with a Local DB
                p If you're developing a new feature for a site that's already live, you likely need to tweak your settings locally before deploying. Once you've perfected your configuration on your development machine, it's easy to send the settings to your production server. Just push to the server, replacing your remote database with your local one.

          li
            h3 Database Export & Backup
            p Not only can WP Sync DB pull and push your DB: it can export your DB to an SQL file that you can save and backup wherever you want. No need to ssh into your machine or open up phpMyAdmin.

          li
            h3 Encrypted Transfers
            p All data is sent over SSL to prevent your database from being read during the transfer. WP Sync DB also uses HMAC encryption to sign and verify every request. This ensures that all requests are coming from an authorized server and haven't been tampered with en route.

          li
            h3 Automatic Find & Replace
            p When migrating a WordPress site, URLs in the content, widgets, menus, etc need to be updated to the new site's URL. Doing this manually is annoying, time consuming, and very error-prone. WP Sync DB does all of this for you.

        h2 Isn't this the same as WP Migrate DB Pro?
        :markdown
            No, of course not, don't be silly. I took out the license verification code, a really shady looking PressTrends reporter, and the tab for installing the Media Files addon before I published 1.4. Release 1.3 was the same as [WP Migrate DB Pro](https://deliciousbrains.com/wp-migrate-db-pro), but I've made several improvements since then.

        h2 Is this Illegal?
        :markdown
          **No.** Just because this is based on the paid-for WP Migrate DB Pro, it doesn't mean I can't release it. WP Migrate DB Pro is released under GPLv2, a copyleft license that guarantees my freedom (and the freedom of all users) to copy, distribute, and/or modify this software.
          I _was_ forced to rename it from "WP Migrate DB" to "WP Sync DB" after Delicious Brains decided to trademark the name "WP Migrate DB", [filed a DMCA takedown](http://wptavern.com/dmca-takedown-notice-issued-against-fork-of-wp-migrate-db-pro) against the repo, and threatened to take me to court. But they should be OK with it now.
